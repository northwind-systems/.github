# 🌊 Welcome to Northwind Systems

> *Reduce operational drag through automation, clarity, and intelligent knowledge systems.*

## 🏢 Who We Are

Founded in 2014 by three former field-operations engineers, **Northwind Systems** is on a mission to modernize documentation and automation across industries. We believe that great systems are built on great knowledge—and we're proving it every day.

**Headquarters:** Denver, Colorado  
**Offices:** Austin, Seattle, Toronto (R&D)

---

## 🧬 Our Culture

We're proud to be a **Documentation-First** organization. At Northwind:
- Shipping undocumented code isn't just frowned upon—it's unacceptable
- Every engineer completes a **"Week of Flow"** rotation with our support teams
- We celebrate documentation wins in our weekly **"Northwind Notes"** digest
- Repos without READMEs are lovingly called **"ghost ships"** 👻

## 🚀 What We Build

### Three Core Platforms

🔧 **Northwind Platform**  
Developer experience and internal tooling that makes engineering teams more productive.

⚡ **Northwind Flow**  
Workflow automation & integrations that eliminate manual toil.

🗺️ **Northwind Atlas**  
Org-wide documentation & knowledge discovery powered by AI agents.

---

## 🛠️ Our Stack

We're committed to modern, maintainable infrastructure:

- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform (multi-cloud)
- **Configuration Management:** Ansible
- **Cloud Providers:** Azure (primary) + GCP (secondary)
- **AI-First Development:** GitHub Copilot + Custom Agents
- **Documentation:** Microsoft Learn architecture model

---

## 🎯 Engineering Standards

Every Northwind repository follows our **Northwind Repo Standard**:
- `/docs/` folder (always)
- Root-level `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Mermaid sequence diagrams for services
- **4-Document Rule** for microservices: Overview, How It Works, Runbook, FAQ

We enforce quality through CI:
- ✅ Broken link detection in Markdown
- ✅ Outdated diagram checks (90-day freshness)
- ✅ API spec consistency validation

---

## 🤖 AI & Automation

We're not just using AI—we're **leading with it**:

- **GaleForce CLI:** Scaffolds repos, generates docs, provisions environments
- **MCP-Powered Agents:** Auto-update API refs, dependency graphs, architecture maps
- **Knowledge Graph Registry:** Auto-indexes markdown across all repos
- **Custom Copilot Agents:** Specialized agents for docs, architecture, and linting

---

## 📚 Documentation Philosophy

> **"Thin Services, Thick Knowledge"**

Our services are simple; our documentation is rich. Every document includes:
- **Context Blocks** with Summary, Owner, Last Verified date
- Quarterly maintenance reviews
- Validated diagrams and cross-references
- Technical accuracy verification

---

## 🎓 Learning & Growth

- **Starter Pack** for new engineers (CLI tools, top 15 repos, ADRs)
- **Docs Gym** monthly sessions to improve documentation skills
- **Architecture Roast** for collaborative technical review
- Recognition through `#docs-wins` channel

---

## 🔐 Security First

No repo becomes production-eligible without:
- ✅ Threat model documentation
- ✅ Dependency review
- ✅ Integration diagram standards
- ✅ Quarterly Actions workflow audits

---
